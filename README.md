<h2>Grunt_bootstrap_less</h2>
With this package you can start frontend project. It provides full implementation of integration of the following technologies:<br>
<ul>
<li>NPM packages menager;
<li>Bower packages menager;
<li>Grunt javascript task runner;
<li>JQuery and its plugins (UI, color);
<li>Less (with lesshat library);
<li>RequireJs for modular javacript.
</ul>
It is possible to add as many libraries as it is needed. Then just include proper files to grunt tasks. Instead of lesshat you may wish to use npm prefixer. 
<br>
